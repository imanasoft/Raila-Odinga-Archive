Media entries surface both archival and contemporary materialsâ€”from 1991 KBC broadcasts of opposition rallies to high-resolution imagery captured during AU infrastructure summits.[^kbc][^flickr]

Each item includes alt text, captions, and licence notes, while audio-visual records provide transcript paths or captions to ensure accessibility.[^transparency]

Video documentation of the 2018 handshake announcement is linked to related policy narratives and speeches, illustrating how the gallery reinforces context across the site.[^reuters]
