Election disputes have been a recurring feature of Odinga's career, notably the annulled 2017 presidential poll where the Supreme Court cited irregularities in results transmission.[^supreme][^guardian]

Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International document periods of political violence and state responses to protests associated with opposition campaigns, highlighting allegations of excessive force alongside calls for restraint from Odinga and state actors.[^hrw][^amnesty]

Transparency watchdogs continue to evaluate corruption allegations involving political allies across party coalitions, underscoring the need for verifiable procurement and campaign finance disclosures.[^transparency]
