Raila Odinga was born on 7 January 1945 in Maseno, Western Kenya, as the son of Jaramogi Oginga Odinga—who later served as the country's first Vice President—and Mary Juma Odinga.[^britannica][^parliament]

Archival oral histories describe a household steeped in civic debate, with siblings encouraged to participate in community affairs and educational pursuits.[^library] Odinga married Ida Anyango Oyoo in 1973, building a family whose members remain active in public life, including daughter Rosemary's social entrepreneurship work.[^nation]

His formal education included attendance at Maranda High School, followed by technical studies at the Herder Institute in Leipzig and the Technical University of Magdeburg, where he obtained a mechanical engineering diploma in 1970.[^britannica][^kenyatta]

Upon returning to Kenya, Odinga taught at the University of Nairobi's Department of Mechanical Engineering and managed the family's Standard Processing industrial venture—experiences that informed his later advocacy for industrial policy and youth skills training.[^parliament][^nation]
