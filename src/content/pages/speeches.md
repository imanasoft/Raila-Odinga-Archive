The archive catalogues major speeches, including Odinga's 2017 Chatham House lecture outlining an opposition roadmap and the 2018 handshake address focused on national cohesion.[^chatham][^reuters]

Budget debates recorded in the Kenyan Hansard capture Odinga's parliamentary arguments on fiscal decentralisation, complementing contemporary commentary that tracks his evolving rhetoric on governance and inclusion.[^hansard][^africa]

Each record links to verified transcripts, related policies, and media assets, allowing readers to corroborate quotations and contextualise remarks across election cycles.
