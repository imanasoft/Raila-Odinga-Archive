Raila Amolo Odinga was born on 7 January 1945 in Maseno and studied mechanical engineering in East Germany before returning to help build a fledgling republic grounded in constitutionalism and public enterprise.[^britannica]

He became a central figure in Kenya’s push for multi-party democracy, enduring detention without trial after the 1982 coup attempt and later organising broad reform coalitions that opened space for competitive elections.[^nation][^parliament]

Parliamentary records document his service as Member of Parliament for Langata, cabinet tenures in energy and infrastructure, and ultimately his stewardship of the Grand Coalition as Prime Minister, illustrating a progression from opposition organiser to executive leadership.[^parliament][^wikipedia]

Odinga carried this reformist voice onto global stages—from advocating inclusive growth at the 2008 World Economic Forum on Africa to championing regional infrastructure as the African Union’s High Representative.[^wef][^africanews]

He repeatedly sought the presidency, most recently in the tightly contested 2022 election that underscored Kenya’s need for institutional transparency while cementing his stature as the country’s leading opposition statesman.[^bbc]

The March 2018 handshake with President Uhuru Kenyatta marked a decisive turn toward bipartisan dialogue and later secured cross-coalition support for Odinga’s African Union Commission bid, signalling rare national consensus around his continental experience.[^reuters][^reuters-au]

Odinga died on 15 October 2025 while receiving treatment in Kochi, India, prompting a seven-day national mourning period, a state funeral programme, and tributes from Kenyan and global leaders.[^bbc-obit][^mygov-report]

His remains arrived in Nairobi on 16 October 2025 with full military honours ahead of a public viewing and burial in Bondo, closing a chapter that spanned underground activism, national leadership, and diplomatic bridge-building.[^star-body]

The archive now foregrounds memorial updates alongside lifelong achievements, pairing new imagery with reorganised navigation so researchers can distinguish real-world developments from site releases at a glance.

President William Ruto’s administration confirmed full military honours, a Nyayo Stadium memorial, and a Bondo interment as part of the seven-day national mourning directive.[^bbc-obit][^mygov-report]

### Repatriation timeline
A Kenya Air Force escort delivered Odinga’s body to Jomo Kenyatta International Airport on 16 October 2025, where military pallbearers led a solemn procession witnessed by Ida Odinga and senior government officials.[^star-body]

### Continental tributes
Regional allies maintained their endorsement of Odinga’s African Union Commission candidacy, framing his pan-African infrastructure agenda as part of his enduring legacy.[^africanews][^reuters-au]

### Reform dialogue milestones
The National Dialogue Committee’s 2023 recommendations and the Kenya Kwanza broad-based governance report continue to shape bipartisan reform priorities instituted under Odinga’s watch.[^nadco][^mygov-report]
