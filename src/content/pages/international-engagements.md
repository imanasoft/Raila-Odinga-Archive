In October 2018 the African Union Commission appointed Odinga as High Representative for Infrastructure Development, tasking him with accelerating flagship transport and energy corridors across the continent.[^au]

He has since participated in East African Community infrastructure summits and cross-border financing discussions anchored by regional lenders, advocating for blue economy strategies and energy interconnections.[^eac][^afdb][^undp]

Odinga also undertakes bilateral outreach, such as 2023 consultations with the United States ambassador in Nairobi that addressed electoral reforms and regional stability.[^usdos]
