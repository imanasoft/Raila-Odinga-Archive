The Credits page collates the structured source registry that powers the site, exposing licensing, reliability, and topical metadata for every citation referenced across the archive.

Media assets include explicit captions, alt text, creator names, publication dates, and license terms to uphold reuse obligations. The automated coverage matrix summarises source expectations for each focus area so editors can quickly spot gaps or outdated material prior to release.

## ODM Visual Identity

The ODM orange (`#f57400`) and blue (`#114b9b`) tokens were sampled directly from the party crest and masthead published on the official ODM site. These assets establish the colour hierarchy that guides the new navigation, callout, and citation treatments across the archive.
