Odinga emerged as a prominent opposition organiser during the single-party era, later serving as a cabinet minister and, following the 2007-08 crisis, Kenya's second Prime Minister in the Grand Coalition Government.[^guardian][^gazette]

He has contested five presidential elections—1997, 2007, 2013, 2017, and 2022—using coalition platforms that emphasised constitutional reform, devolution, and anti-corruption safeguards.[^guardian][^economist][^brookings]

The 2022 election defeat to William Ruto led to a Supreme Court petition and subsequent nationwide debate on electoral commission transparency, reinforcing Odinga's calls for institutional accountability.[^bbc]

Ongoing regional diplomacy and party leadership keep Odinga at the centre of Kenya's political negotiations, even when serving in opposition benches.[^economist]
