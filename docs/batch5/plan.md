# Batch 5 Plan — Design System Foundations (15 Oct 2025)

## Objectives
- Define accessible, classic editorial design tokens covering color, typography, spacing, sizing, motion, and elevation.
- Document responsive component specifications aligning with Batch 4 wireframes and accessibility guardrails.
- Deliver reusable CSS variable exports and guidance to accelerate future Astro implementation.

## Tasks & Estimates
| Task | Description | Owner | Estimate |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Token research | Align palette, typography, spacing, and motion values with accessibility targets | Design Lead | 5h |
| CSS variable authoring | Encode tokens in CSS with theming hooks and reduced-motion fallbacks | Front-end Lead | 6h |
| Component spec drafting | Document anatomy, states, and accessibility requirements for key components | UX Designer | 10h |
| Accessibility review | Validate contrast ratios, focus indicators, and motion guidelines | Accessibility Specialist | 4h |
| Stakeholder review | Circulate deliverables for feedback and sign-off | Team | 3h |

## Dependencies
- IA and wireframe decisions from Batch 4 for structural alignment.
- Content tone and sourcing policies from Batches 1–2 for component copy examples.

## Risks & Mitigations
| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Insufficient contrast in classic palette | High | Medium | Start with contrast-checked palette values and document alternative tints for overlays. |
| Component scope creep | Medium | Low | Prioritize components referenced in Batch 4 wireframes and backlog additional requests. |
| Overly rigid tokens hindering localization | Medium | Medium | Provide scale tokens with defined ratios and allow per-locale overrides via CSS custom properties. |
| Motion accessibility gaps | High | Medium | Define reduced-motion behavior for every animated component and include prefers-reduced-motion queries. |

## Definition of Done
- CSS token file committed with documented color, typography, spacing, layout, border, and motion variables.
- Component specifications covering states, accessibility notes, and responsive behavior stored under `docs/batch5/`.
- Reduced-motion and high-contrast guidance documented.
- Deliverables referenced in batch summary awaiting approval for Batch 6 handoff.

## Next Steps After DoD
- Translate tokens into Astro layout scaffolding during Batch 6.
- Build component partials leveraging tokens and validate with content samples in Batch 8.
