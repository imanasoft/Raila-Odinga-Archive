# Timeline Explorer â€” Implementation Notes (15 Oct 2025)

## Overview
The Batch 7 timeline explorer renders YAML-backed event data with progressive enhancement. Initial render occurs server-side for
fast first paint, while a lightweight client script (3.2 KB minified) updates results instantly on filter changes and maintains
URL parameters for shareable states.

## Data Inputs
- `content/events/*.yaml` mapped into `TimelineDisplayEvent` objects, retaining `sources` arrays for citation badges.
- Derived fields include `startYear`, `endYear`, `decadeValue`, and merged `topics` sourced from `timeline_display.filters` and
  `categories`.
- Events without valid start dates are ignored; a TODO note is logged for future data validation.

## Accessibility & UX
- Filter form works with or without JavaScript. `aria-live="polite"` announces result counts, and filter controls expose
  accessible labels.
- Timeline items use semantic headings, lists for topics and sources, and maintain sufficient contrast for state indicators.
- Reduced-motion preference removes transition effects.

## Performance
- Client enhancement avoids re-downloading data by serialising the event array once into a JSON script tag.
- CSS keeps layout responsive with pure CSS connectors and no heavy libraries.

## Next Steps
- Extend filters to include role/person facets once Batch 8 populates additional metadata.
- Integrate print stylesheet adjustments for long-form chronology exports.
