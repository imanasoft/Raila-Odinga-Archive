# Content Style Guide (15 Oct 2025)

## Voice and Person
- Use third-person perspective.
- Maintain neutral, encyclopedic tone across all sections.

## Tense
- Historical narratives: past tense.
- Current roles or ongoing initiatives: present tense.
- Future commitments: conditional language with sourced evidence.

## Structure
- Begin with concise summary sentence including citation.
- Follow with context, chronology, and implications, each supported by sources.
- Use short paragraphs (3–4 sentences) for readability.

## Accessibility
- Provide descriptive headings following semantic order.
- Write alternative text that conveys purpose and essential details.
- Caption all multimedia and include transcripts for audio/video.

## Inclusivity and Sensitivity
- Respect cultural and political nuances; avoid colloquialisms.
- Use full names on first reference, then surnames.
- Identify individuals’ titles or roles when contextually relevant.

## Citations
- Reference sources via inline citation badges linking to `credits` section anchors.
- For contentious facts, include at least two independent sources representing differing perspectives.
- Document access date for online sources in `data/sources.yaml`.

## Formatting
- Use Markdown for content authoring.
- Follow AP style for dates (e.g., “15 Oct 2025”).
- Numbers under 10 spelled out unless part of data/statistics.

## Review Process
- Draft → Editorial review for neutrality → Fact-check verification → Accessibility check → Publish.
- Record reviewer and date in update log entry.
