# Batch 4 Plan â€” IA, Wireframes, and UX Flows (15 Oct 2025)

## Objectives
- Define navigation information architecture aligned with canonical outline.
- Produce low-fidelity wireframes for mandated key pages across mobile, tablet, and desktop breakpoints.
- Document core UX flows with emphasis on keyboard navigation and accessibility.

## Tasks & Estimates
| Task | Description | Owner | Estimate |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| IA mapping | Draft navigation hierarchy, breadcrumbs, related-content logic | IA Lead | 6h |
| Wireframes | Create annotated low-fi wireframes for Home, Timeline, Biography, Policies hub, Speech detail, Gallery, Credits | UX Designer | 14h |
| Responsive considerations | Specify mobile, tablet, desktop adaptations and responsive behaviors | UX Designer | 6h |
| Keyboard & accessibility flows | Document keyboard sequences, focus order, skip links, screen reader notes | Accessibility Specialist | 5h |
| Review & sign-off | Cross-check with sourcing and content teams, incorporate feedback | Team | 3h |

## Dependencies
- Canonical outline and content model from Batch 1 & 3.
- Source coverage insights from Batch 2 for linking citation touchpoints.

## Risks & Mitigations
| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Navigation overload | Medium | Medium | Use progressive disclosure via section landing pages and filters; validate against personas. |
| Wireframe ambiguity | High | Low | Annotate layouts with content priorities, states, and accessibility notes. |
| Keyboard flow gaps | High | Medium | Conduct task-based walkthroughs per persona scenarios and align with WCAG 2.2 AA. |
| Timeline complexity | High | Medium | Define phased interaction levels with fallback static view and ensure progressive enhancement. |

## Definition of Done
- Navigation model, breadcrumbs, and related-content patterns documented and reviewed.
- Wireframes for all required pages include mobile, tablet, and desktop variants with annotations.
- UX flows cover keyboard navigation, focus management, and key persona journeys.
- Deliverables stored under `docs/batch4/` and referenced in batch summary.

## Next Steps After DoD
- Prepare design tokens and component specs in Batch 5 using wireframe insights.
- Validate IA with content ingestion prototypes during Batch 8.
