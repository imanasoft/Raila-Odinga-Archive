# Batch 6 Summary â€” Static Site Scaffolding (15 Oct 2025)

## Implemented
- Bootstrapped an Astro project with TypeScript, design token imports, accessible layout primitives, and navigation scaffolding.
- Configured integrations for sitemap generation, RSS feeds, and responsive images alongside Netlify deployment defaults.
- Established content collections for pages and updates with exemplar markdown entries, plus update detail routing and RSS output.
- Added linting (ESLint), formatting (Prettier), and supporting tooling documentation via README updates.

## Next Steps
- Extend collections to mirror full JSON Schema coverage (families, roles, policies, media) ahead of Batch 8 ingestion.
- Implement interactive timeline and visual components in Batch 7, leveraging the established layout and token system.
- Automate credits page population and cross-reference `data/sources.yaml` once dynamic loaders are implemented.

## Testing Snapshot
- `npm run lint`
- `npm run build`
