# Batch 1 Plan â€” Discovery and Canonical Outline (15 Oct 2025)

## Objectives
- Establish foundational understanding, goals, and structure for the Raila Odinga static site.
- Define key audiences, success metrics, and project risks to guide subsequent batches.
- Produce canonical information architecture outline and supporting inventories to accelerate later implementation batches.

## Tasks and Estimates
| Task | Description | Owner | Estimate |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| T1 | Review requirements, confirm toolchain, outline deliverables | Lead Architect | 3h |
| T2 | Draft project brief with objectives, scope, constraints, audiences, success metrics | Lead Architect | 5h |
| T3 | Identify risks, mitigations, and governance practices | Lead Architect | 3h |
| T4 | Produce canonical site outline to level-3 headings covering all mandated sections | Lead Architect | 6h |
| T5 | Draft content model (YAML), page inventory, component inventory, taxonomy list | Lead Architect | 6h |
| T6 | Document neutral language guidelines and sourcing policy | Lead Architect | 3h |

Total estimated effort: 26 hours within Batch 1 timeframe.

## Dependencies
- None external; relies on existing requirements and desk research.

## Risks and Mitigations
| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Scope creep across historical coverage | High | Medium | Freeze outline scope in Batch 1, apply change control for future additions. |
| Insufficient source reliability guidance | High | Medium | Establish sourcing policy and neutral language guide in Batch 1, enforce via reviews. |
| Overly complex content model | Medium | Medium | Start with modular yet extensible YAML schemas, validate against future content needs. |
| Accessibility overlooked in later batches | High | Low | Embed accessibility checkpoints into success metrics and IA decisions from outset. |

## Definition of Done
- Project brief, audience profiles, success metrics, risks/mitigations documented.
- Canonical site outline reaching level-3 headings and covering required sections up to 15 Oct 2025.
- Draft content model YAML reflecting key entities.
- Page and component inventories enumerated.
- Taxonomy list aligned with navigation and tagging strategy.
- Neutral language guideline and sourcing policy drafted.
- All artifacts stored under version control in `docs/batch1/` or `docs/guidelines/`.
